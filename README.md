# Project #: 3

* Author: Abbie Sarmento, Adam Adri
* Class: CS361 Section 2
* Semester: Spring 2024

## Overview

This program simulates a bi-infinite Turing Machine (TM). The 
bi-infinite piece shows that it has a tape that goes infinitely 
in both directions. The TM's are deterministic and all come to a 
halt with no reject state.

## Reflection

The things that worked well in this project were that we had previous projects to look
at and help us implement this assignment. Understanding how the maps work and how to use 
them was really helpful in structuring the TM. It was also helpful to be able
to structure this in a way that made sense to us. We were able to understand our program
better because we had a structure that we understood. 

We struggled originally with understanding how we should implement the project. 
The project was fairly open-ended and up to us to decide how to proceed with a file
structure and that is ultimately what worked to our advantage. Because we tried to
simplify the code, this helped us debug and find any issues in our program. The run()
method was the main method that presented us issues, but with some debugging, we were 
able to figure out our issues with it fairly quickly. Overall, this was a good project,
and we worked well together in implementing the desired functionality. 

## Compiling and Using

To compile, cd into the main directory and compile:
$ cd tm
$ javac *.java

To run the test files provided:
$ java TMSimulator ../test/file#.txt

## Sources used

We used our previous projects to assist in this project.
